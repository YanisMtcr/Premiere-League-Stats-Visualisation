    "The analysis of Premier League player performances for the 2018/2019 season has revealed several trends and identified interesting characteristics regarding the distribution of players, their contributions, and the overall dynamics of the league.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used Statistical Analysis: : \n",
    "- Descriptive statistics were used to understand the distribution of  our  variables \n",
    "- Confidence intervals for means and proportions were calculated to assess the reliability of our estimates.\n",
    "- Goodness-of-fit tests were performed to check if the data followed known distributions .\n",
    "- Hypothesis tests, including chi-squared and t-tests, helped us compare the performance across different groups, such as position, age, and nationality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis revealed important insights into player participation in the Premier League. While goalkeepers play more minutes than forwards, the number of appearances is generally balanced across these positions. Age and nationality also play a role in a player’s involvement, with younger players having fewer appearances and German players playing more minutes than the English .\n",
